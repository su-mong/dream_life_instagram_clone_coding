# DramyLIFE : Instagram Clone Coding Project

This is an Instagram clone coding project.

### The carefully implemented parts are as follows:
- Clean Architecture using Bloc pattern
- Live chat with socket
- Using some complex animations
- making some test files for logic test
- Simple live broadcast using webRTC (Maybe...?)

### Frameworks
- Frontend : Flutter
  - state-management : Bloc
  - routing : go-router
  - DI : ???
- Backend : Nest.js or FastAPI...? I'm thinking about what to use.

### Articles
I will write articles about this project. After I finish this project, I will update the link here :)
